# JavaScript Blackjack Game
This JavaScript-based game offers interactive gameplay where you aim for a hand closest to 21. Enjoy hitting or standing in this browser-based rendition of the beloved card game!

## How the Game Works

The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the browser. Players interact with the game through a user interface, making choices and drawing cards based on the following gameplay flow:

1. Players can choose between "Hit" (drawing a card) or "Stand" (keeping the current hand).
2. If the player chooses to "Hit," they receive another card.
3. The game continues until the player's total card value does not exceed 21, or the player chooses to "Stand."
4. At the end of the game, the player or the dealer (computer) with the hand closest to 21 wins.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the project files to your computer.
2. Open the downloaded files in a web browser.
3. Start the game by opening the `blackjack.html` file.
